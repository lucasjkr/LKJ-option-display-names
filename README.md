# opencart-option-display-names
## by Lucas Krupinski

This VQMOD gives every option a display name in addition to a name.

The use case for this is where you have have different option sets for different manufacturers with the same name.

This way in your back end you can give that option set it's own name ("ABC Co - Colors" and "XZY Inc - Colors") while displaying them both as "Color" to the customer.

Two VQMOD's are included, one that should work with Opencart 2.x installations, and a second that should work with 3.0 installations (tested with 3.0.2.0 only)

Note that by request I am rushing out a version for 3.0, so please provide feedback if it causes you any issues. I have only tested with a stock Opencart 3 install with the default themes.

Thanks!
